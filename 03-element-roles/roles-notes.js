We use role selectors instead of more classic ways of finding elements, like CSS selectors.\n\nARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to help make web applications more accessible to users with disabilities. These attributes provide additional information about the purpose and behavior of an element, which can be used by assistive technologies such as screen readers to improve the user experience.\n\nEven though these ARIA roles are an additional topic to memorize, we engineers use them because they allow us to write more flexible tests.  In many cases it doesn't matter if an element is presenting text in an `h1` element or an `h3` element.  By finding elements based on their role, we can make small changes to a component and not break its respective test.  Some engineers do not care for this flexibility.  If you don't wish to use ARIA roles, you can always fall back to using standard CSS selectors.\n\nSome elements - not all - are 'implicitly' (or automatically) assigned a role.  Some of the more commonly-used roles can be found in the `RoleExample` component below.\n\n","type":"text","id":"2ks6y"},{"content":"import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\n\nfunction RoleExample() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Link</a>\n      <button>Button</button>\n      <footer>Contentinfo</footer>\n      <h1>Heading</h1>\n      <header>Banner</header>\n      <img alt=\"description\" /> Img\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" /> Checkbox\n      <input type=\"number\" /> Spinbutton\n      <input type=\"radio\" /> Radio\n      <input type=\"text\" /> Textbox\n      <li>listitem</li>\n      <ul>listgroup</ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nrender(<RoleExample />);\n","type":"code","id":"0bipm"},{"content":"Many elements have roles that are easy to memorize.  Here are some of the easier ones to remember:\n\n| Element               | Role    |\n|-----------------------|---------|\n| `a` with `href`       | link    |\n| `h1`, `h2`, ..., `h6` | heading |\n| `button`              | button  |\n| `img` with `alt`      | img     |\n\nOther elements can be a little more challenging to remember.

You can be more specific by finding elements based upon their role *and* their accessible name.\n\nThe accessible name of most elements is the text placed between the JSX tags.  For example, the accessible name of `<a href=\"/\">Home</a>` is `Home`.\n\nIn the component below, two `button` elements are displayed.  The only difference between them is the text they contain.  Their accessible names are `Submit` and `Cancel`, respectively.","type":"text","id":"px1n7"},{"content":"import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\n\nfunction AccessibleName() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button>Submit</button>\n      <button>Cancel</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nrender(<AccessibleName />);\n\n","type":"code","id":"r7kil"},{"content":"## Selecting By Accessible Name\n\nElements with a defined acessible name can be selected by passing a filtering object to the `getByRole` method.

Defining accessible names for them is done differently.\n\nTo define an accessible name for `input` elements in particular, you can associate the input with a `label`.  The `input` element should have an assigned `id` prop, and the label should have an identical `htmlFor` prop.  Once this link has been formed, the `input` can then be selected by using the `label` text as an accessible name.","type":"text","id":"rlxq5"},{"content":"function MoreNames() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n      <input id=\"email\" />\n\n      <label htmlFor=\"search\">Search</label>\n      <input id=\"search\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nrender(<MoreNames />);\n","type":"code","id":"ccj1g"},{"content":"test('shows an email and search input', () => {\n  render(<MoreNames />);\n\n  const emailInput = screen.getByRole('textbox', {\n    name: /email/i,\n  });\n  const searchInput = screen.getByRole('textbox', {\n    name: /search/i,\n  });\n\n  expect(emailInput).toBeInTheDocument();\n  expect(searchInput).toBeInTheDocument();\n});","type":"code","id":"p9a75"}]
